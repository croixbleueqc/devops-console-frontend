Configure the app plugin on your workspace:

```json
"<your-scope>/demo-app/devops-console-demo": {},
```

Head over to your app's `netlify.ts` file to configure your Netlify deployer:

```ts
const netlifyConfig: NetlifyOptions = {
  team: 'my-team',
  accessToken: process.env.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN,
  siteName: 'my-wonderful-site',
};
```

Tag your app component to deploy it:

```bash
bit tag demo-app/devops-console-demo
```

Visit the site you have set and view your newly deployed app. For example: https://devops-console-demo.netlify.app/.
